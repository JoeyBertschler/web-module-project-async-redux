build an app from scratch
use api
display data received from it

- [x ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ n/a] Add your team lead as collaborator on Github.
- [x ] Clone your OWN version of the repository in your terminal.
- [n/a ] CD into the project base directory `cd React-Redux-App`.

- [ ] Start up the app using `npm start`.
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

- [ ] Build a React Redux app
- [ ] Fetch data inside an async action creator from an API of your choosing
- [ ] Add the data from the API to the Redux store
- [ ] Display the data from the store in a component
- [ ] _Some_ styling must be applied. It can be basic, but the app must not only use browser default stylings

### Task 3: Stretch Problems

Take the app as far as you can go! Styling, redux hooks, another API, an input to fetch data dynamically, etc. Work on it, improve it until the end of the day. If you find yourself finishing with time left to spare, jump on with your TL or fellow student to ask them what feature they think you should build next. Good luck!

## Submission Format
* [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge `<firstName-lastName>` Branch into `main` (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
